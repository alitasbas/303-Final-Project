# 303-Final-Project
STAT303 is a 5th-semester core statistics course. This is the final project of the course. 
🤼 consists of @ismetlogoglu and @yunusalparslan.
We are given three samples taken from three different populations. Our goal is to find these distributions.
Finally, we will apply the statistical methods taught in class to predict the parameters.
